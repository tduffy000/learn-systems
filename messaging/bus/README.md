# Message Bus
People (like me) like to ride buses. They take you places. You know where they're going to go. And you don't have to go underground so you can still doom-scroll while riding them! Computers provide [buses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)) too, just they're moving data not people (yet).
